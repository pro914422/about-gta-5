<div>"Grand Theft Auto V" (GTA 5) is an action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, and features a vast open world for players to explore.

    The game follows the story of three criminals: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips, and Franklin Clinton, who are drawn into committing heists while dealing with their own personal struggles and conflicts. Players can switch between these characters during missions to approach objectives from different perspectives.
    
    GTA 5 offers a wide range of activities beyond the main storyline, including driving, shooting, flying aircraft, and participating in various side missions and mini-games. The open-world environment allows players to freely roam the city of Los Santos and its surrounding countryside, engaging in activities such as car customization, purchasing properties, and interacting with NPCs.
    
    The game's online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online, allows players to create their own character and explore the world of Los Santos with friends or other players. In GTA Online, players can participate in various missions, races, heists, and other activities to earn money, level up, and unlock new content.
    
    GTA 5 received widespread critical acclaim upon release, praised for its open-world design, narrative, characters, and gameplay mechanics. It became one of the best-selling video games of all time, with its engaging single-player campaign and extensive multiplayer mode contributing to its enduring popularity.</div>
